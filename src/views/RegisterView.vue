  TODO: "multi-step-form"
  (in my opinion) The best here would be to have what it's called a "multi-step-form" as a
  dynamic component, so we can add one more "step" which is going to be the
  user data inputs (name, email, password, confirm_password, etc), and we will
  be able to re-use it to create multiple user profiles

  I don't know if I'm explaining myself here, if there is any question about
  it feel free to ask me (att: Nico)
